# Stackline Assessment

This project contains my submission for Stackline's frontend assessment. The app is deployed to GitHub Pages at https://andjohnsmith.github.io/stackline-assessment/.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and contains additional dependencies on [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/).

## Useful Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Starts a new GitHub Pages deployment. More information on this process can be found in [the Create React App docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
